	<h3>Deep-Focus Color Game 2022</h3>
	<hr/>
	<p>Hello Friend!</p>
	<p>
	  I need your :brain:!<br/>
	  I just coded a very simple game about <b>deep-focusing</b>, and I need your help for validating it please!
	  It take only 2-5 min.
	</p>
	<div>

	  The game is very easy to play. (read the text at the top, select the related circle/box)
	  <ol>
		<li><b>(important)</b> Use a headphone with proper(high) volume, as app may asks vary color to be selected as you score more(needed)</li>
		<li>A color(let say <span style="color:red">"Red"</span>) is selected randomly (but "Red" could be in "Green" (like <span style="padding: 3px;background-color: green">"Red"</span>), stay <b>focused!</b>)</li>
		<li>You need to find and click the box colored "Red" (like <span style="background-color:red;padding: 5px">Z</span>).</li>
	  </ol>
	</div>
	<p>
	  Try to score over 10(record is 17). If you fail, try again, and again. Keep trying, and focusing!<br/>
	  Share your thoughts by <a href="https://gist.github.com/911992/c94913abc0513f141baf5043218422df">messaging me</a>.

	<p><i><b>Hint:</b> you may record yourself while playing the game(recommended)</i>
	</p>
