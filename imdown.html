	<h3>Deep-Focus Color Game 2022</h3>
	<hr />
	<p>Hello Friend!</p>
	<p>
	  I have developed a very simple game which helps you <b>enhance</b> your focus and responsiveness.
	</p>
	<p>
	  It's still in an early stage and I would appreciate it if you test it and give me suggestions to make it better.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Important:</b> Since the game is fast-paced, there are a few audio cues to indicate correct, wrong, or missed choices so that the player does not need to get distracted by looking at the progress. <b>You may turn the volume up</b> and use a <b>headphone</b> for a better experience.
	</p>
	<hr/>
	<div>

	  The game is very easy to play. (read the text at the top, select the related circle/box)
	  <ol>
		<li>Press "new game" to start.</li>
		<li>Read the text at the top and select the circle that has said color as fast as you can.</li>
		<li>You gain scores by selecting the right circle before timeout. Try to score as much as you can.</li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>
		<b>Hint:</b> Don't trust your eyes! You have to select the color based on what the <b>text</b> says not the highlighting.
		For example, <span style="padding: 3px;background-color: green">"Red"</span> is highlighted in green but you have to select the red circle.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<hr/>
	<p>
	  If you liked the game please share your thoughts and give a star the project on GitHub.
	</p>
	<p><i><b>Hint:</b> you may record yourself while playing the game(recommended)</i>
	</p>
